## Using Individual Components

You can also use the individual notice components for more semantic clarity:

<NoticeInfo title="Did you know?">
You can use the individual `<NoticeInfo>`, `<NoticeWarning>`, etc. components directly in your MDX files for better readability.
</NoticeInfo>

<NoticeWarning title="Performance Tip">
Consider using dynamic imports for large components that are not immediately needed to improve initial load performance.
</NoticeWarning>

<NoticeSuccess title="New Feature">
We've just added dark mode support! You can toggle it using the theme switcher in the navigation bar.
</NoticeSuccess>

## Custom Styling

The notice components also accept additional CSS classes for custom styling:

<Notice type="notice" title="Custom Notice" className="mt-8 border-dashed">
This notice has custom styling applied using the `className` prop. You can add any Tailwind CSS classes you need.
</Notice>
