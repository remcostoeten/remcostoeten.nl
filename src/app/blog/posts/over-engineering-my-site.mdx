title: 'New site 🎉 Self-induced neuronal deficiency is an over-engineering catalyst'
publishedAt: '2025-10-06'
summary: 'Building a simple personal website that spiraled into over-engineering territory: custom npm packages, monorepo setup, multiple APIs integration, and several scrapped features along the way.'

It started as a simple idea: *"I just need a place to put my thoughts."*

Three months, two monorepo migrations, and a custom build tool later, I finally have... a place to put my thoughts. But was it worth it? Absolutely not. Would I do it again? In a heartbeat.

## The Stack

I decided to forego the usual suspects (Next.js, Remix) initially to write my own static site generator. Why? Because I hate myself, apparently. But also because I wanted to understand the **build process** intimately.

```javascript
// The initial build script
const build = async () => {
  const posts = await fs.readdir('./posts');
  // ... complexity ensues
}
```

### Key Features I Didn't Need But Added Anyway

- Real-time weather data in the footer (because why not?)
- A custom markdown parser that supports ASCII art natively
- **Three** different state management libraries just to toggle dark mode

In the end, I moved everything to Next.js because I missed Hot Module Replacement. The irony is not lost on me.
