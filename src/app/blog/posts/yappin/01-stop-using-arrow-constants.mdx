Aaah, JavaScript. The language we all love. It does come with its own set of quirks which we just have to deal. For example being able to calculate with strings and integers combined
```javascript
console.log(1 + 2) // 3
console.log(1 + "2") // onetwo
```
Another gem is `NaN` (not a number). Litterly checking if a value is not a number.. Right?
```javascript
console.log(typeof NaN)           // number 
console.log(Nan === NaN)         // false
console.log(Number.isNaN(NaN)); // true
```
