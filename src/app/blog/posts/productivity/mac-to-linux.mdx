title: "Linux is the goat, my personal dotfiles"

summary: "I switched to Linux on my work machine and personal computer and have increased my productivity by a lot."

At all my jobs, I've always been an Apple user. I've owned a **2009 MacBook**, a **2017 Pro**, an **M2 Pro**, a fully spec'd **M3 Pro**, and an **M3 Air**. The displays, battery life, and build quality are undeniable—but eventually, macOS started feeling... *sluggish*.

Taming macOS animations, dealing with Mission Control quirks, and the lack of a proper tiling window manager made me crave something faster. The switch to Linux unlocked a level of control and immediacy I didn't know I was missing.

<NoticeInfo title="The Dotfiles">
Of course, migrating to Linux involves tinkering. I built an evolving dotfiles repo of scripts and tooling that shape my workflow. You can check it out on my [GitHub](https://github.com/remcostoeten/dotfiles) (if it's public!).
</NoticeInfo>

My setup is now **keyboard-first**; the mouse is a last resort. One tool that made this shift possible is **Zoxide**.

## Zoxide: Smarter Navigation

Zoxide lets you jump to directories without typing full paths. It learns from your navigation history, ranks directories by frequency, and lets you teleport around your filesystem.

Instead of this ancient ritual:

```bash title="The Old Way"
cd ~/development/active/skriuw
```

You just type:

```bash title="The Zoxide Way"
z sk
```

<NoticeSuccess title="It gets smarter">
The more you use it, the smarter it becomes. It turns directory navigation into muscle memory.
</NoticeSuccess>

### How it works
For example, my Skriuw project lives at:
`/home/remco-stoeten/development/active/skriuw`

Launching a terminal usually drops me into:
`/home/remco-stoeten/.config/dotfiles`

Typing `z web` might be ambiguous if I have multiple `web` folders, but Zoxide supports multi-argument matching:

```bash title="Fuzzy Matching"
z sk w
```

Boom. Zoxide narrows the match and jumps straight into `/home/remco-stoeten/development/active/skriuw/apps/web`. Even deeper paths like `packages/db/migrations` resolve instantly.


## Aliases and Command Chaining

I am a big fan of aliases. Why type four commands when you can type one?

Here are a few of my favorites:

| Alias | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `rmall` | `rm -rf node_modules .next` | Nukes dependencies and build artifacts |
| `i` | `bun install` | Fast installs with Bun |
| `b` | `bun build` | Production build |
| `rs` | `next start` | Preview the production build |

I often chain these together to clean, install, build, and start my app in one go:

```bash title="The Ultimate Combo"
z .nl ; rmall ; i ; b ; rs
```

Here is what that looks like in action:

```bash title="Terminal Output"
❯ pwd
/home/remco-stoeten/.config/dotfiles

dotfiles on  master 
❯ z .nl ; rmall ; i ; b ; rs

Effectivly what happend here without aliasses is this:
```bash
cd /home/$USER/development/active/skriuw
cd apps/web
rm -rf node_modules 
rm -rf .next
*logic for checking if there is a dist or vite folder*
bun install
bun build
bun run start
```
Removing all generated files and testing a fresh build.

### Spellchecker

Another one which saves me quit some time is my [spellchecker](https://github.com/remcostoeten/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/spellcheck) script. This lets me type `spellcheck` and on enter it prompts me to enter text, but passing text as an argument also works.

```bash
 spellcheck  "i m writing a blog ppooost about my person
al dvlopment enviorment"
→ Spellchecking with claude profile done            
→ Done.

Corrected text:
I'm writing a blog post about my personal development environment.

Result copied to clipboard.
Applied 4 change(s).
```
Under the hood it checks wether you have one of the most common AI CLI's installed (that take prompts via argument) and runs it with the text you passed to it. In this case it uses Claude (with Z.ai) but could've also used Codex, Cursor or Gemini.

If curious you could test any of these scripts or the entire package by simply running my install script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/remcostoeten/dotfiles.git;
cd dotfiles/setup;
bun install;
bun run dev
``` 
which prompts you with a interactive menu
```
