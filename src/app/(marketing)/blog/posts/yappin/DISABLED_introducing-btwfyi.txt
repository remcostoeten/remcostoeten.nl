While my CLI todo system works beautifully for terminal-based workflows, I found myself facing a new problem: **What about tasks that need to stay visible while I'm working in the browser or other GUI applications?**

The terminal is great for quick capture and reminders, but when I'm deep in code on VS Code, debugging in the browser, or designing in Figma, I'm not looking at my terminal. I needed something that would keep my tasks persistently visible, regardless of what application I'm using.

That's when I built [**btwfyi**](https://github.com/remcostoeten/btwfyi).

### What is btwfyi?

**btwfyi** (pronounced "bit-wai-fai") stands for "by the way, for your information" - and it's exactly that. A lightweight task awareness overlay designed specifically for development environments.

Think of it as your persistent sticky note layer that sits on top of your interface, keeping your tasks always in view without being intrusive. No more alt-tabbing to check your todo list, no more forgetting what you were supposed to work on next.

### The Problem It Solves

As a neurodivergent developer, I struggle with:
- **Task switching amnesia** - Start working on something, get distracted, completely forget what I was doing
- **Out of sight, out of mind** - If my todo list isn't visible, it might as well not exist
- **Context switching overhead** - The mental cost of switching between my code editor and a separate todo app

btwfyi solves all of these by making tasks an integrated part of your development interface.

### Core Features

#### 1. **Persistent Overlay**
Tasks float above your interface, always visible but never in the way. You can position them wherever makes sense for your workflow.

```tsx
import { Btwfyi } from "@remcostoeten/btwfyi/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Btwfyi 
        category="current-sprint" 
        categories={categories}
        enabled={true} 
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 2. **Smart Syntax Parsing**
Natural language task entry with automatic parsing. No need to manually set tags, priorities, or dates - just type naturally:

- `"Fix login bug tomorrow #auth !high"` → Automatically parses:
  - Text: "Fix login bug"
  - Due date: tomorrow
  - Tags: ["auth"]
  - Priority: high

The system understands:
- **Dates**: "tomorrow", "next friday", "dec 31"
- **Tags**: #bug, #feature, #urgent
- **Priority**: !high, !medium, !low

#### 3. **Bulk Import**
Got a bunch of tasks from a meeting or brainstorming session? Just paste them as a Markdown list:

```markdown
- Fix login bug #auth
- Add dark mode #ui !medium
- Update docs
```

btwfyi will parse and import all of them automatically.

#### 4. **AI Enhancement**
This is where it gets really cool. btwfyi supports two AI modes:

- **Local AI**: Uses Chrome's `window.ai` (Gemini Nano) for offline task enhancement. Your data never leaves your machine.
- **Cloud AI**: Optional Grok integration for smarter parsing and task suggestions.

The AI can help break down vague tasks into actionable steps, suggest priorities based on context, and even organize related tasks together.

#### 5. **Command Palette**
Press `Alt + K` anywhere in your app to open the global command palette. Search across every task, jump directly to what you need, or manage your overlays:

- Show/hide specific overlays
- Clear completed tasks
- Reset task statuses globally
- Search across all categories

#### 6. **Import/Export Everything**
Your data, your format:
- **Export**: Copy tasks as Markdown, JSON, or even Slack-formatted messages
- **Import**: Paste JSON arrays or Markdown lists directly

No vendor lock-in. Your tasks are just data.

### Framework Support

Currently supporting:
- **React** - Full TypeScript support with hooks and context
- **Vue** - Composition API with full reactivity

More frameworks coming soon.

### Why I Built This

Traditional todo apps are designed for project managers and productivity gurus. They're packed with features I don't need and missing the ones I do.

I needed something that:
- ✅ Works with my development workflow, not against it
- ✅ Stays visible without requiring app switching
- ✅ Is fast to capture thoughts (CLI speed with GUI persistence)
- ✅ Doesn't require internet or cloud sync
- ✅ Respects my data ownership
- ✅ Integrates with AI without being dependent on it

btwfyi is that tool.

### The Two-System Approach

Now I use both systems in tandem:

1. **CLI todo** - For quick capture, time-based reminders, and terminal-first workflows
2. **btwfyi** - For persistent awareness, GUI-based work, and complex task organization

When a task is time-sensitive or needs a notification, it goes into the CLI system. When a task needs to stay visible while I work, it goes into btwfyi.

Sometimes tasks exist in both places, and that's okay. The redundancy actually helps - if I forget to check one, the other catches me.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @remcostoeten/btwfyi
# or
pnpm add @remcostoeten/btwfyi
# or
yarn add @remcostoeten/btwfyi
```

### Real-World Usage

Here's how I actually use it day-to-day:

```tsx
const workCategories: CategoryConfig[] = [
  {
    id: "today",
    displayName: "Today's Focus",
    items: [
      { text: "Finish blog post #writing !high", action: "add" },
      { text: "Review PR #347 #code-review", action: "review" },
      { text: "Fix Vigilo positioning bug #bugfix !urgent", action: "fix" },
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "this-week",
    displayName: "This Week",
    items: [
      { text: "Refactor auth flow #refactor", action: "refactor" },
      { text: "Set up CI/CD for new project #devops", action: "setup" },
    ],
  },
];

function DevLayout() {
  return (
    <>
      <Btwfyi 
        category="today"
        categories={workCategories}
        enabled={process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'} 
        position="top-right"
      />
      {/* Rest of your app */}
    </>
  );
}
```

The overlay sits in the top-right corner of my screen, always showing me what I should be working on. When I complete a task, one click marks it done. When I think of a new task, `Alt + K` opens the command palette and I can add it instantly.

### The Bottom Line

If you're neurodivergent, have ADHD, or just struggle with keeping track of tasks across multiple contexts - give btwfyi a try. It's designed by someone who gets it, for people who get it.

The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/remcostoeten/btwfyi), and the package is on npm as `@remcostoeten/btwfyi`.

No tracking, no telemetry, no cloud dependency. Just a tool that helps you remember what you need to do, when you need to remember it.

Because sometimes, the best productivity system is the one that meets you where you already are.
