# Bulk Delete Feature Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a bulk delete feature for your CMS pages. This allows you to select multiple pages and delete them all at once.

## Features Implemented

### 1. API Endpoint
- **New API Route**: `/api/cms/pages/bulk-delete`
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: `{ pageIds: string[] }`
- **Protection**: Home page is protected from bulk deletion

### 2. Backend Updates
- **CMS API Client**: Added `bulkDeletePages(pageIds: string[])` method
- **Pages State Hook**: Added `bulkDeletePages` action with proper error handling
- **Reducer**: Already had `DELETE_PAGES_BULK` action (was unused before)

### 3. UI Updates
- **Checkboxes**: Added to each page item (except home page)
- **Selection State**: Each page can be individually selected/deselected
- **Bulk Actions Bar**: Appears when pages are selected showing:
  - Count of selected pages
  - "Select All" checkbox
  - "Delete Selected" button
  - "Clear" button to deselect all

### 4. User Interactions

#### Selection Methods
1. **Checkbox**: Click the checkbox next to each page
2. **Alt+Click**: Hold Alt and click anywhere on a page row to toggle selection
3. **Select All**: Use the checkbox in the bulk actions bar

#### Bulk Operations
- **Delete Selected**: Click the "Delete Selected" button
- **Clear Selection**: Click "Clear" to deselect all pages
- **Confirmation**: Bulk delete shows confirmation dialog with count

### 5. User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected items are clearly indicated
- **Protection**: Home page cannot be selected or bulk deleted
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during bulk operations
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for success/failure
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Alt+click for quick selection

## How to Use

1. **Select Pages**: 
   - Click checkboxes or Alt+click on page rows
   - Use "Select All" to select all selectable pages

2. **Bulk Delete**:
   - Click "Delete Selected" in the bulk actions bar
   - Confirm the deletion in the dialog
   - Pages will be deleted and UI updated

3. **Manage Selection**:
   - Click "Clear" to deselect all
   - Individual checkboxes to fine-tune selection

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `/src/app/api/cms/pages/bulk-delete/route.ts` (new)
- `/src/lib/cms/api-client.ts`
- `/src/hooks/use-pages-state.ts`
- `/src/components/cms/pages-list.tsx`
- `/src/components/admin/cms/cms-section.tsx`

### Key Features
- **State Management**: React state for selection tracking
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately after successful API call
- **Error Recovery**: Proper error handling with user feedback
- **Accessibility**: Proper form elements and keyboard support
- **Performance**: Memoized components and callbacks

## Safety Features
- Home page is protected from bulk deletion
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Clear visual feedback for selected items
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

The feature is now fully functional and ready to use!
