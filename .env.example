# Spotify API Configuration
# Required for music integration on the homepage

# 1. Get your credentials from: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
#    - Create a new app
#    - Set redirect URI to: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/spotify/callback
#    - For production, update the redirect URI to your production domain

# 2. OAuth Configuration
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/spotify/callback

# 3. Public variables (client-side access)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/spotify/callback

# 4. Refresh Token
# To get a refresh token, use the Spotify OAuth flow once:
# Visit: https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=user-read-currently-playing user-read-recently-played&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
# Then exchange the authorization code for a refresh token
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_spotify_refresh_token

# Note: For Spotify integration to work, you need both:
# - Client ID and Client Secret (for server-side API calls)
# - Refresh Token (to get user-specific data like currently playing tracks)
# Without refresh token, you'll only get public data with limited access
