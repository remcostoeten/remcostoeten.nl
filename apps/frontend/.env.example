# API Environment Configuration
# Options: 'local' | 'production'
# This determines which API endpoint to use
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENV=local

# You can also override this at runtime by:
# 1. Adding ?api=production or ?api=local to the URL
# 2. Using localStorage: localStorage.setItem('apiEnvironment', 'production')
# 3. The app will default to 'local' in development and 'production' in production builds
