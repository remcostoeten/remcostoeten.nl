# Getting Started with MDX

MDX is a powerful format that allows you to write JSX directly in your Markdown files. This means you can create rich, interactive content that combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX directly in your Markdown files. It's perfect for creating:

- **Interactive documentation**
- **Rich blog posts**
- **Educational content**
- **Component showcases**

## Why Use MDX?

There are several benefits to using MDX:

1. **Familiar syntax**: If you know Markdown, you already know most of MDX
2. **Component integration**: Use React components directly in your content
3. **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support
4. **Performance**: Server-side rendering with Next.js

## Basic Example

Here's a simple MDX file:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

# My Blog Post

This is a regular paragraph with **bold text** and *italic text*.

<Button>Click me!</Button>

## Code Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Components

You can create custom components for your MDX content:

```jsx
<Callout type="info">
  This is an informational callout with custom styling.
</Callout>
```

### Interactive Elements

MDX allows you to include interactive React components:

```jsx
<Counter initialValue={0} />
```

### Tables

| Feature | MDX | Markdown |
|---------|-----|----------|
| JSX Support | ✅ | ❌ |
| Components | ✅ | ❌ |
| Type Safety | ✅ | ❌ |

## Best Practices

1. **Keep components simple**: Don't overcomplicate your MDX components
2. **Use TypeScript**: Take advantage of type safety
3. **Optimize images**: Use Next.js Image component for better performance
4. **Test your content**: Make sure all components work correctly

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful tool for creating rich, interactive content. It combines the best of Markdown and React, making it perfect for modern web applications.

> **Pro tip**: Start with simple Markdown and gradually add components as needed.

Happy writing! 🚀
