# Building Scalable React Applications

When building React applications that need to scale, proper architecture becomes crucial. Here are the key principles I've learned over the years.

## Component Architecture

Start with a clear component hierarchy and avoid deeply nested components. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.

```jsx
// Good: Single responsibility
function UserAvatar({ user, size = 'medium' }) {
  return (
    <img 
      src={user.avatar} 
      alt={user.name}
      className={`avatar avatar-${size}`}
    />
  );
}

// Avoid: Multiple responsibilities
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  // This component does too much
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={user.avatar} alt={user.name} />
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.bio}</p>
      <button onClick={() => editUser(user.id)}>Edit</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## State Management

Choose the right state management solution for your needs. Not every app needs Redux - sometimes React's built-in state is enough.

### When to use what:

- **useState**: Local component state
- **useContext**: Shared state across components
- **Zustand**: Global state management
- **React Query**: Server state management

## Code Organization

Organize your code by feature, not by file type. This makes it easier to maintain and understand the codebase as it grows.

```
src/
├── modules/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── types.ts
│   └── blog/
│       ├── components/
│       ├── hooks/
│       └── types.ts
└── shared/
    ├── components/
    ├── hooks/
    └── utils/
```

## Performance Considerations

- Use `React.memo` for expensive components
- Implement proper key props for lists
- Consider code splitting for large applications
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` judiciously

## Conclusion

Building scalable React applications requires careful planning and consistent patterns. Start simple and refactor as your application grows.
